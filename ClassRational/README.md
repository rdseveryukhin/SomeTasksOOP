A Rational class that describes a rational number. It defines add, sub, mul, and div methods that add a number to it, subtract a number, multiply by a number, and divide by a number, respectively. In addition, it defines the neg method, which reverses the sign.

The +=, -=, *=, /= operators are defined for the Rational class so that they can take both Rational type objects and integers as arguments. In addition, unary minus and plus operators are defined for the Rational class.

The operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined for the Rational class, so that objects of the Rational type can be added (subtracted, multiplied, and divided) not only with each other, but also with integers.

The operators <, <=, >, >=, ==, != for the Rational class are implemented so that it is possible to compare objects of the Rational class not only with each other, but also with integers.

Cast operator to double.
