In this assignment, you need to develop iterators for the VectorList container, which stores data in a list of vectors. To simplify the task, you are required to implement only const iterators (forward and reverse), and also implement the begin, end, rbegin, and rend methods. Filling the container will happen using the append method, which is already implemented. The append method ensures that there are no empty vectors in the list.
